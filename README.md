# KnightChessBoardJumps
How many jumps will it take for a Knight to jump from one position to the next on a user-defined chessboard, written in C++

This code was created to make as fast as possible calculations for how many jumps it would take for a knight on a chessboard to go from one position to an end position.

So far, it takes around a second. Of course, it is possible to get it faster, but this is my best result so far; the code works, but the tree and nodes are not optimal.

To optimize the code the use of Square root(SQRT) and power(POW) could be changed as they are very expensive compared to pure mathematical methode.
